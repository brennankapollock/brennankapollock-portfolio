              <p>
                i grew up in the dirt of knockemstiff, ohio. a place where the
                woods take care of their own, whether they should or not. i
                learned fast that authenticity isn't a buzzword. it's survival.
                people there still feel like they walked out of steinbeck
                novels, carrying stories no professor could stomach without
                choking on his own theories.
              </p>
              <p>
                i spent my twenties preaching, chasing priesthood, thinking
                philosophy and theology would crack open the marrow of the
                sacred. they did, but not how i expected. the man from galilee
                wrecked me into being both an anarchist and a communist, which
                made sunday mornings a circus. i got accused of being
                "possessed" just for quoting him straight, but i never lost the
                scent of divinity. i had to watch god die in my body to realize
                i didn't need to go anywhere. it was already here. vulgar,
                small, ordinary. alive.

                faith and politics carried me into communes, asylum work,
                translating desperation into legalese that maybe, if luck was
                drunk, turned into freedom.
              </p>
              <p>
                then six years ago i pivoted. not out of betrayal, but
                exhaustion. i traded scripture for sprint planning, solidarity
                for systems. and i crushed it. tech came easy. the ladder looked
                built for me. but the higher i climbed the more dead i felt.
                every part of me that could stir bodies and spirits, make a room
                feel alive, got shoved in a corner so i could play the role of
                responsible adult.
              </p>
              <p>
                until last year. one dance on the beach cracked me wide open. i
                hadn't moved like that since nashville nights, sweating whiskey
                under cheap lights. that one dance set off a chain reaction.
                heartbreak, ecstasy, recognition. reminded me what it feels like
                to be human instead of productive. flesh instead of machine.

                so now i'm on sabbatical. resurrection, not rest. sleeping in my
                car. pissing at sunrise and waving to farmers. swimming naked
                with strangers. ayahuasca circles. journals full of encounters
                that smell more like life than any quarterly review.

                these days i work with people who are sick of performing. the
                ones who built perfect lives and feel empty anyway. i don't hand
                them tools for efficiency. i hand them matches. the world
                doesn't need more polished systems. it needs people willing to
                burn down the stage and walk off barefoot.

                my writing comes from whitman's wide-open lungs, merleau-ponty's
                body-first philosophy, mystics who knew god hid in the mundane,
                and the people i've met who showed me revolution begins in
                breath, sweat, surrender.

                i believe in embodied spirituality. no gurus. no retreats. just
                courage. i believe in blurring masculine and feminine until the
                categories snap. in clothing-optional communion with the earth.
                in wisdom stuffed inside junk drawers full of sex, dirt, and
                god.

                and into who they are. not more human capital. just more human.
