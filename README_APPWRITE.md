# Appwrite CMS Setup - Quick Start

## ðŸš€ Automated Setup (5 minutes)

The fastest way to get your CMS running.

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ installed
- Appwrite account at [cloud.appwrite.io](https://cloud.appwrite.io) (free tier works great!)

### Steps

#### 1. Create Appwrite Project (2 min)
```
1. Visit https://cloud.appwrite.io
2. Sign up / Log in
3. Click "Create Project"
4. Name it (e.g., "Portfolio CMS")
5. Copy the Project ID (you'll need this next)
```

#### 2. Create API Key (1 min)
```
1. In your project, go to: Settings â†’ API Keys
2. Click "Create API Key"
3. Name: "Setup Script"
4. Scopes: Select All (or at minimum: databases.*, storage.*)
5. Click Create
6. Copy the API Key (shown only once!)
```

#### 3. Run Setup Script (2 min)
```bash
npm run setup-appwrite
```

The script will ask you for:
- **Appwrite Endpoint**: Just press Enter (uses cloud.appwrite.io)
- **Project ID**: Paste the ID from step 1
- **API Key**: Paste the key from step 2

The script automatically creates:
- âœ… Database
- âœ… Collections (blogPosts, stashItems, drafts)
- âœ… Storage bucket for images
- âœ… Proper permissions and indexes
- âœ… `.env.local` file with all IDs

#### 4. Create Admin User (30 sec)
```
1. In Appwrite console: Auth â†’ Users
2. Click "Create User"
3. Email: your@email.com
4. Password: (create a secure password)
5. Click Create
```

#### 5. Test It! (30 sec)
```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit: `http://localhost:3000/admin`
Login with the credentials from step 4.
